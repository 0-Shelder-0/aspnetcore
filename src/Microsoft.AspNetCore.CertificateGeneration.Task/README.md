### Testing scenarios

On a machine without an SSL certificate generated by this task. Create a netcoreapp2.0 mvc application using

```
dotnet new mvc
```

Then try to run the app using:

```
dotnet run
```

When the application fails to run due to a missing SSL certificate. Run:

```
dotnet msbuild /t:GenerateSSLCertificate
```

Run the application again using:

```
dotnet run
```

The application should run successfully. You will still have to trust the certificate as a separate step.
