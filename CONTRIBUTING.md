## Filing issues

When filing issues, please use our [bug filing templates](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Functional-bug-template).
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you read the [documentation](https://github.com/aspnet/home/wiki)?
2. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
3. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
4. What package versions are you using (you can see these in the `project.json` file)?
5. What operating system are you using?
6. What version of IIS are you using?

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.
