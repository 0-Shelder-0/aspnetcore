## Filing issues

The GitHub issue list is for bugs, not discussions. If you have a question or want to start a discussion you have several options:
- Post a question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-vnext)
- Start a discussion in our [ASP.NET vNext forum](http://forums.asp.net/1255.aspx/1?ASP+NET+vNext) or [JabbR chat room](https://jabbr.net/#/rooms/aspnetvnext)

When filing issues, please use our [bug filing templates](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Functional-bug-template).
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.
Providing a minimal project with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information.

1. Did you read the [documentation](https://github.com/aspnet/home/wiki)?
2. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
3. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
4. What package versions are you using (you can see these in the `project.json` file)?
5. What operating system are you using?
6. What version of IIS are you using?

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.
