ASP.NET Core Basic Middleware Components
========

This repo hosts a collection of basic middleware components for ASP.NET Core. This includes Buffering, HTTP Overrides, and URL Rewriting. 
The Rewrite middleware can import rules from IIS's UrlRewrite and Apache's mod_rewrite.

This project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) repo.
